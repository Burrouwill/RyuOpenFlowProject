CORE COMPLETED?

Currently We have this:

* Added 2 flows for each host, one for INCOMING packets, one for OUTGOING packets
* Each flow redirects the packet to the controller 
* The controller is currently annoucining this
* The _flow_stats_reply_handler method is also constantly printing the tabele 
* FOr the COMPLETION --> I need to make it so that only h1 infor is printed WHEN IT IS UPDATED (i.e. actually receiving packets) 
* For 



* Idead for challenege:

Switchg to using bidirectional flows For chal;lenge --> Get the stats, somehow for everything but only if diff in packet 
Need fields for each stat / packet count 
need a MAX var
If total packet count > MAX --> We add a flow that drops the packets for that path with a higher priority 


Monitor flows --> If packet count > MAX_PACKETS add a new flow with a higher priority that drops the packets
