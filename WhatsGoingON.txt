CORE COMPLETED

Currently We have this:

* Added 2 flows for each host, one for INCOMING packets, one for OUTGOING packets
* Each flow redirects the packet to the controller 
* The controller is currently annoucining this
* The _flow_stats_reply_handler method is also constantly printing the tabele 
* FOr the COMPLETION --> I need to make it so that only h1 infor is printed WHEN IT IS UPDATED (i.e. actually receiving packets) 
* For 


            if ipv4_src == h1_ipv4 or ipv4_dst == h1_ipv4:
                
                
                self.h1_packet_count += 1
                self.logger.info('Total Packets To & From 10.0.1.1: %d', self.h1_packet_count)



* Idead for challenege:

Monitor flows --> If packet count > MAX_PACKETS add a new flow with a higher priority that drops the packets
